/**
 * This Jekyll theme doesn't really use SASS, just regular CSS files (assets/css).
 * 
 * Leaving this here since CloudCannon has some SASS styles, and in case anybody in the future wishes
 * to add more SASS (CSS preprocessor) or make use of variables. 
 * Jekyll automatically scans and compiles .scss files it finds.
 * More info: https://sass-lang.com/

/* Dependencies can be found in the _sass directory */
