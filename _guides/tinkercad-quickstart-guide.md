Tinkercad is an easy to use yet powerful 3D design program that runs right in your web browser. By adding and combining simple 3D shapes you can create almost anything you can imagine\! In this guide you'll learn how to create a new project, how to add shapes, and how to navigate in the Tinkercad workspace.

### Step 1: Login to Tinkercad

In a web browser, navigate to [Tinkercad.com](http://www.tinkercad.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and create a new account if you don't have one yet. If you already use Fusion 360, you can use the same Autodesk login.

### Step 2: Create a new design

Click the "Create new design" button to open up a new project.

### Step 3: Add a shape

When your project first opens, you'll see a large window on the left with a flat 3D workplane, and on the right a sidebar with several shapes to choose from. You can add a shape to the workplane by simply clicking and dragging a shape from the sidebar and dropping it on to the workplane.

### Step 4: Adjust the camera view

Imagine that you are looking through a camera at the shape you just created. To look at the shape from a different perspective, you can pan, zoom, and orbit around the workplane.

The controls for pan, zoom, and orbit are located on the left side of your screen. Click and drag the large cube shaped icon (viewcube) to orbit, or click on the + and - icons to zoom in and out. Click the home icon to reset the view to the default perspective.

You can alternatively use keyboard and mouse shortcuts to control the camera.
