      #### Items in Use


      * Keep antiques away from windows. Rotate items incrementally over time to
      reduce irregular sun fading. Curtains can help.
        * Grandfather clocks are often the most sun-damaged antique.&nbsp;
      * Cover surfaces with cloth to reduce scratches.&nbsp;

      #### Items in Storage


      * Cover with a sheet and keep items away from the window.&nbsp;

      * Check on stored antiques at least once a year to monitor for termites
      and water damage.&nbsp;

      * Stored wooden furniture still needs to be waxed once a year.

      #### Metal


      * Silver: Polish

      * Gold: Polish

      * Brass/ Bronze/ Copper:&nbsp; Consider polishing, but probably leave the
      patina

      * Iron: Wash with warm water,&nbsp; scrub with kerosene, polish with steel
      wool (+rust remover), rinse thoroughly, dry with a cloth.

      * Steel: Prevent rust. Clean with vinegar and lime solution. Consider
      painting, powder coating, or re-surfacing steel that is&nbsp; seriously
      deteriorating,&nbsp;

    content_markdown: >-
      #### Cleaning Your Antiques


      * Cleaning should be minimal. Cleaning too much will get rid of the
      ***patina*** and reduce the antique's value.
        * ***Patina***\: Thin layer that variously forms on the surface of copper, brass, bronze and similar metals, or certain stones, and wooden furniture, or any similar acquired change of a surface through age and exposure.
      * Lightly wiping down surfaces with water, a rag, and a small amount of
      soap is the safest way to clean antiques. Other methods: vinegar,
      denatured alcohol&nbsp;

      #### Cleaning Your Antiques


      * Always do individual research on items before cleaning to see what is
      recommended.&nbsp;

      * Try the least strong cleaning method first. If not satisfied, try a more
      intensive method. i.e: Water -&gt; Vinegar

      * Avoid commercial cleaning products, even plant based ones, unless
      explicitely recomended. Every day cleaners are not meant for antiques.

      #### Dusting Your Antiques


      * Dust with a soft wet rag.
        * Wiping a surface with a dry rag will create micro-scratches.&nbsp;
      * Some antique experts prefer to dust with feathers, but this method is
      contentious. Critics of this method worry that quills scratch wood.&nbsp;

      #### Waxing Wooden Furniture


      * Wood Furniture needs to be waxed 1 - 2 times per year. More than that
      can cause damage to your wooden furniture.&nbsp;

      * Pure beeswax is preferable. A good commercially available wax is Howard
      Feed-N-Wax

    content_markdown: >-
      #### Refinishing


      * Chemicals for stripping wood can be harmful and refinishing will often
      reduce the value of antiques. People still choose to refinish if pieces
      are extremely damaged or if they have a strong aesthetic preference.&nbsp;

      * Types of finishing: Wood Stain, Polyurethane, Lacquer, Shellac, Tung
