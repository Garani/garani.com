In this guide, you'll learn how to sew a simple drawstring bag out of reusable materials. You can use it as a reusable produce bag, snack sack, or small gift bag.

#### **Tools and materials needed**

1. **Fabric.** You can use almost any fabric for this project, but we recommend [hemp](https://www.etsy.com/listing/546939909/hmong-hill-tribe-hemp-hand-woven-hemp){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} since it is a sustainable organic fiber that requires half as much land and water compared to cotton.
2. **String/Rope.** You'll need twine, jute, thin rope, long shoelaces or similar to use for your drawstring.
3. **Sewing machine (or needle and thread).** You can sew this bag by hand but a sewing machine will be much faster. Either way you'll need the usual sewing supplies: thread, scissors, ruler, and sewing pins. A [bone folder](https://www.joann.com/fiskars-bone-folder/10224780.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [tailors chalk](https://www.joann.com/dritz-tailor-chalk-refill-white/1049832.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and fabric iron are also recommended.

### STEP 2

Fold over and press flat using a bone folder and a hot iron. If you don't have a bone folder you can use a wooden stick, dull knife or letter opener.

### STEP 3

Sew down both ends. Don't forget to [backstitch (aka reverse stitch)](https://doitbetteryourself.club/blog/how-to-back-stitch-and-why-its-important/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the beginning and end of each seam\!

### STEP 8

Line up the edges of A and pin B. It's ok if the edges of B don't line up exactly or have some overhang.

---

### STEP 9

Sew along the edges of B. You don't have to sew right along the edge, you can leave some margin or overhang and trim it later.
