### Types of AI

#### Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

Narrow intelligence refers to the use of AI algorithms to perform specific tasks. Most of the AI used today falls under this category. Examples of this type of AI include facial recognition, Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, self-driving cars, and quality control in factory assembly lines.

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

General intelligence refers to computers replicating the way the human brain works. This type of AI does not exist yet. Th
