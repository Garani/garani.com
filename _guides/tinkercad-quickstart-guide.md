Tinkercad is an easy to use yet powerful 3D design program that runs right in your web browser. By adding and combining simple 3D shapes you can create almost anything you can imagine\! In this guide you'll learn how to create a new project, how to add shapes, and how to navigate in the Tinkercad workspace.

### Step 1: Login to Tinkercad

In a web browser, navigate to [Tinkercad.com](http://www.tinkercad.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and create a new account if you haven't yet. If you use Fusion 360, the login will be the same.

### Step 2: Create a new design

Click the "Create new design" button to open up a new project.

### Step 3: Add a shape

When your project first opens, you'll see a large window on the left with a flat 3D workplane, and on the right a sidebar with several shapes to choose from. You can add a shape to the workplane by clicking and dragging a shape from the sidebar and dropping it on to the workplane.

### Step 4: Adjust the camera angle

When creating 3D designs, need to look at your design from many different angles. To do that, you can adjust the camera view. Just like a real camera, you can zoom in and out, and move it around, above, and below your design.

In Tinkercad there are a couple different ways to adjust the camera view.&nbsp; Let's take a look at the vertical toolbar on the left side of your screen. To orbit, click and drag the cube shaped icon (viewcube). As you drag the viewcube, the camera perspective will change along with it. You can also click on one of the sides to snap to side view. If you get lost or turned upside down, you can click the home icon to reset the camera to the default camera perspective.

To zoom in, click the + button, and to zoom out, click the â€“ button. To zoom in on a shape, click on the shape in the workplane and then press the \[ &nbsp; \] button to zoom fit.

The bottom button in the left vertical toolbar allows you to switch between Perspective view (default) or Flat View (orthographic). This is similar to changing the lens in a camera. When the camera is looking straight down from one side (i.e. top view) in Perspective view some of the shapes may look distorted. Switching to Flat View will flatten the shapes so they look less distorted.

Step 5: Move, resize, and rotate shapes

To move a shape that you have added, hold down the left mouse button to drag it to a different area of the workplane.

To resize a shape, click on it and
