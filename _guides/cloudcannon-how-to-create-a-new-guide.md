This guide demonstrates how to create a how to guide (similar to the one you are reading) for the CPL Maker Lab website using the CloudCannon admin interface.

### Step 1

Log in to [CloudCannon](cloudcannon.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. CloudCannon is a website management platform.&nbsp; CloudCannon will sync changes to Github Pages, where the site is hosted.

### Step 2

When you first login, it will show you a list of websites. For the free tier of CloudCannon, you can only create one website. Click to open the website dashboard.

### Step 4

In the sidebar, enter a title for your guide. In categories, enter only **ONE** topic category for the guide. The topic category is used to organize your guide on the guides landing page. You can enter as many tags as you'd like, however.

**Optional:** Add more details such as an example image, difficulty level, time required, and file attachment. These details will be shown at the top of the page.

### Step 5

It's a good idea to save often as you work, so go ahead and click the SAVE button. CloudCannon will display a message that it is saving and rebuilding the site.

### Step 6

It's a good idea to save your work as you go. Click the Save button at the top. CloudCannon may display a status message as the site is rebuilt. Click the "Return to Slide deck" to view your list of slides.

## Step 8

Add a new slide and give it a title , but this time don't add any text, just upload a background image. The background image will fill the entire screen and will be easy for people to see. Don't forget to hit save\!

## Step 9

To view your slide deck, go to [cplmakerlab.github.io/slidedecks](http://cplmakerlab.github.io/slidedecks){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and click on your new slide deck, which will open in a new window. Be aware that it may take a minute or two to see your changes as the site needs time to rebuild after every change. When presenting, take advantage of the built-in keyboard shortcuts\!
