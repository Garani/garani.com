These basic instructions will teach you how to make a simple fabric mask with elastics and preferably up-cycled fabric. The design process also allows for an optional nose support and can also accomodate a filter insert.

### What you'll need

* Sewing machine or a needle and thread
* 100% cotton fabric with a tight knit like from a flat sheet, pillow case, or dress shirt
* Two hair ties or elastic tied in rounds
* Twist ties, craft wire, or pipe cleaners (optional)

### Fabric & Sizing

For the body of the mask cut one piece of fabric- size suggestions as follows:

* Youth (5" x 14")
* Adult S/M (6" x 16")
* Adult L/XL (7.5" x 18")

This is customizable, basically you need the mask height to be the short edge and the long edge will be double the width of your finished mask. If you want to test a size, cut a template from scrap paper and hold it up to your face (example- for the S/M cut a 6" x 8" template). It should cover both your nose and go under your chin.
