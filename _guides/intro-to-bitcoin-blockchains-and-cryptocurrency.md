In this short introductory guide, we'll talk briefly about what Bitcoin is and how it works. We'll also talk about blockchain technology and other cryptocurrencies.

### What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital cash network and payment system created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) named Satoshi Nakomoto. One of the founding principles of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized, meaning there is no central authority that controls the network. This is often contrasted with traditional paper money such as the US dollar which is minted and issued by a central bank (The Federal Reserve).

The underlying technology that powers Bitcoin is called the "blockchain." This is a shared public ledger that records every payment or transaction. When one person sends Bitcoin to another person, that exchange is verified and permanently recorded to the blockchain using encrypted digital signatures. Bitcoins are issued to "miners" in exchange for verifying a transaction, a reward system that keeps the network going. Unlike traditional currency, the total number of bitcoins that can ever be created is restricted to 21 million. This restriction makes it scarce and drives comparison to other scarce commodities like gold. This has attracted wild price speculation.

You can read the [original Bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which outlines exactly how the system works.

What is Ethereum?

A few years after Bitcoin launched, a community of software developers saw potential in the underlying technology of the blockchain. They wondered if blockchain technology could be expanded to support more applications beyond a single digital currency, such as smart contracts and local currencies. However, early experiments proved that this was quite difficult due to the way Bitcoin was designed.

In 2015 a programmer named Vitalik Buterin launched a new platform called Ethereum, which he described as [A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform.](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} What bitcoin did for money, ethereum did for computer code. This platform was a programming language combined with blockchain technology that made it possible for developers to easily build custom applications that are not controlled by a central authority.

Using this platform, anyone can create their own currency, develop smart contracts for tracking digital assets, and more. Ethereum uses the ECR20 standard

Launched in 2015, Ethereum finally made it possible for developers to create their own niche applications of blockchain technology. Smart contracts, chain of ownership,

The goal of Ethereum was to expand the possibilities of blockchain technology beyond digital money.
