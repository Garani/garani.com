      #### Items in Use


      * Keep antiques away from windows. Rotate items incrementally over time to
      reduce irregular sun bleaching. Curtains can help.
        * Grandfather clocks are often the most sun-damaged antique.&nbsp;
      * Cover surfaces with cloth to reduce scratches.&nbsp;

      * Check on stored antiques at least once a year to monitor for termites
      and water damage.&nbsp;

      * Stored wooden furniture still needs to be waxed once a year.

      #### Cleaning Your Antiques


      * Cleaning should be minimal. Cleaning too much will get rid of the
      ***patina*** and reduce the antique's value.
        * ***Patina***\: Thin layer that variously forms on the surface of copper, brass, bronze and similar metals, or certain stones, and wooden furniture, or any similar acquired change of a surface through age and exposure.
      * Lightly wiping down surfaces with water, a rag, and a small amount of
      soap is the safest way to clean antiques.

      * More intensive cleaning with vinegar, denatured alcohol, and other
      materials is also acceptable but should be avoided
