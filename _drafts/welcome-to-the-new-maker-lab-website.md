For over 7 years the Maker Lab has offered introductory workshops and open shop to encourage community learning, creativity, and collaboration. Our new website tries to reflect and further those goals through our new Learn, Make, and Community sections.

[Learn](/learn) contains how-to guides, slidedecks, videos, upcoming workshop & events, and career training resources.

[Make](/make) contains detailed info about all the software and equipment we use at the Maker Lab.

[Community](/community) contains links to organizations&nbsp; that connect our space to the wider maker movement.

This site was made using Jekyll & Github Pages, and is managed using Cloudcannon. In true maker spirit, all of our site code is available&nbsp; to view and inspect on our [Github](http://github.com/cplmakerlab){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Feel free to fork our site to make it your own\!
