Tinkercad is an easy to use yet powerful 3D design program that runs right in your web browser. By adding and combining simple 3D shapes you can create almost anything you can imagine\! In this guide you'll learn how to create a new project, how to add shapes, and how to navigate in the Tinkercad workspace.

### Step 1: Login to Tinkercad

In a web browser, navigate to [Tinkercad.com](http://www.tinkercad.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and create a new account if you don't have one yet. If you already use Fusion 360, you can use the same Autodesk login.

### Step 2: Create a new design

Click the "Create new design" button to open up a new project.

### Step 3: Add a shape

When your project first opens, you'll see a large window on the left with a flat 3D workplane, and on the right a sidebar with several shapes to choose from. You can add a shape to the workplane by simply clicking and dragging a shape from the sidebar and dropping it on to the workplane.

### Step 4: Adjust the camera view

Imagine that you are looking through a camera at the shape you just created. To look at the shape from a different perspective, you can pan, zoom, and orbit around the workplane.

The controls for zoom and orbit are located on the left side of your screen, or you can use mouse shortcuts to control the camera.

* ORBIT: Click and drag the large cube shape (viewcube) to orbit. Or you can click on one side of the cube to quickly rotate to that side.
* HOME VIEW: Click the home button to reset the camera to the default view.
* ZOOM: Click on the zoom fit button \[F\] to focus on a specific shape. Click on the + button to zoom in, and and the - button to zoom out.
* FLAT VIEW: When the camera is looking straight down from one side (i.e. top) sometimes shapes will look distorted. Switching to Flat View will flatten the shapes so they look less distorted. This is similar to changing the camera lens.

### Step 5: Move, resize, and rotate shapes

MOVE: Click on the shape in your workplane to select it. When selected, you can use the arrow keys to move it around on the workplane. You can also click and drag the shape to quickly move it.

To move a shape that you have added, simply hold down the left mouse button to drag it to a different area of the workplane.

To resize a shape, click on it and
