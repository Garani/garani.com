In this short introductory guide, we'll talk briefly about what Bitcoin is and how it works. We'll also talk about blockchain technology and other cryptocurrencies.

### What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital cash network and payment system created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) named Satoshi Nakomoto. One of the founding principles of bitcoin is that it is decentralized, meaning there is no central authority that controls the network. This is often contrasted with traditional paper money such as the US dollar which is minted and issued by a central bank (The Federal Reserve).

The underlying technology that powers bitcoin is called the "blockchain." This is a shared public ledger that records every payment or transaction. When one person sends bitcoin to another person, that exchange is verified and permanently recorded to the blockchain using encrypted digital signatures. Bitcoins are issued to "miners" in exchange for working to verify a transaction, a reward system that keeps the network going. Unlike traditional currency, the total number of bitcoins that can ever be created is restricted to 21 million. This restriction makes it scarce and drives comparisons to other scarce commodities like gold. This has attracted wild price speculation.

If you are interested in learning the technical details of how bitcoin works, a popular Youtube video ["But how does bitcoin actually work?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} provides a great overview. You can also read the [original bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which outlines *exactly* how the system works.

### What is Ethereum?

A few years after bitcoin launched, a community of software developers saw potential in the underlying technology of the blockchain. They wondered if blockchain technology could be expanded to support more use cases beyond a single digital currency, such as local currencies and smart contracts. However, early experiments proved that this was quite difficult to do with the bitcoin blockchain.

In 2015 a programmer named Vitalik Buterin launched a platform called Ethereum, which he described as [A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform.](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} This platform was a programming language designed to work with blockchain technology, making it possible for developers to build custom applications that are not controlled by a central authority.&nbsp;

With Ethereum, anyone can create their own currency, as well as create smart contracts and build decentralized applications. Developers build on the network by creating or using tokens. There are different standards used to create tokens on the Ethereum network, but the ERC-20 standard is the mostly commonly used. Many, if not most, of the alternative digital currencies that are not bitcoin (a.k.a. altcoins) use the ERC-20 token standard and thus rely on the Ethereum blockchain.

### What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a portmanteau of "cryptography" and "currency". Cryptocurrency has become a general catch-all term to describe any tradeable digital asset that use encrypted digital signatures to verify authenticity.

Cryptocurrency falls into two categories: coins and tokens.

A **coin** refers to a cryptocurrency that has its own blockchain. For example, Bitcoin (BTC) runs on its own blockchain, while Ether (ETH) runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

A **token** refers to a cryptocurrency that relies upon an existing blockchain. Most tokens are built using the ERC-20 token standard and rely on the Ethereum blockchain. Confusingly, tokens are also sometimes referred to as "altcoins." In short, if a cryptocurrency runs on its own blockchain it is a coin -- if not then it is a token.

You can obtain cryptocurrencies either by mining them, buying them, or having someone send them to you. Mining today requires vast amounts of computational power and electricity, making it unprofitable for most. Cryptocurrency exchanges allow one to use traditional "fiat" currency to purchase cryptocurrency coins and tokens. Lastly you can obtain cryptocurrency by creating a "wallet" and having someone send you cryptocurrency.

"Not your keys, not your coins" is a phrase used to warn people about the dangers of storing cryptocurrency on an exchange instead of storing it in your own wallet under your own control. When you leave or store cryptocurrency on an exchange, you don't actually own the keys that control the underlying digital asset. If the exchange is robbed or hacked and the keys are stolen (which has happened), you are simply out of luck as now the thief can transfer the coins to their own wallet. But owning your own wallet comes with its own risks too as you must figure out a way to keep it protected.

In summary, there are three ways you can think about digital currencies:

* digital cash (a.k.a. digital gold)
* a technology (blockchain)
* an ideology (decentralized finance)

Hopefully this guide has helped you understand this topic bit better and given you a new perspective on the subject.
