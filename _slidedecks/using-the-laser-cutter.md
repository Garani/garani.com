      1. Place your material on the honeycomb.

      2. Use the on-screen or keyboard arrow keys to move the laser head to a
      corner of the material.

      3. Use Run Perimeter (7th icon, to the right of the house icon) and watch
      the laser head move to make sure you have space for your design on the
      material.

      4. Adjust material and repeat Run Perimeter as needed.

  - title: Raster Review
    content_markdown: >-
      In Raster Mode, you can set the DPI.


      250 DPI is faster and lower resolution and usually has enough detail for
      most projects.

      The Vector Cut tab shows vector lines and an empty rectangle for raster
      images. You'll tell the laser to ignore the black box by setting the black
      line passes to 0.
