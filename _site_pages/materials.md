### Approved lasercutting materials

The following table shows which materials are safe to cut with a laser. Some materials are dangerous to cut and can release toxic fumes or can catch fire\!

| Wood | *Most untreated hardwoods, softwoods up to 1/4" thick (1/8" is recommended). Thin plywood is ok but does not cut as well due to glue layers.* |
| Plastics | *Acrylic ([cast or extruded](https://www.acmeplastics.com/cast-vs-extruded){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) up to 1/4" thick (1/8" recommended), Mylar sheets* |
| Rubber | *Laser engravable rubber only* |
| Cellulose | *Chipboard, Paper, Cardboard* |
| Fabrics | *Most thin natural fabrics (no wool or leather due to fumes)* |
| Glass | *Etching only, cannot cut* |
| Metal | *Painted or anodized aluminum (engraving only, cannot cut)* |
| **BANNED MATERIALS** | *Food, Chlorinated plastics (PVC), ABS, Rubber, Vinyl, Foam, Treated Wood, Galvanized Metal, Fiberglass, Mirrors* |

Note: Material dimensions must be less than 20"x12".

### <br>Suggested Lasercutter Settings

The following table shows suggested lasercutter settings for various materials. If the laser power is too low or the laser moves too fast, it won't cut. If the laser power is too high or the laser moves too slowly, it can scorch and even set fire to the material. Quite often settings will need to be adjusted due to variations in material manufacturing, as well as fluctuations in laser power. We always recommend testing laser settings on a piece of scrap if possible. If you have any suggestions, please email us at makerspace@chipublib.org and let us know\!
