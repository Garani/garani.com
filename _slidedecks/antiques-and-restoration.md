      ## Differences


      * Antique: 100 years old or more
        * The term originally only referred to goods made before 1830, prior to mass production in the US
      * Vintage: 50 years or more

      * Retro: Refers to anything that imitates an older style, the item does
      not have to genuinely be from said time period.&nbsp;
