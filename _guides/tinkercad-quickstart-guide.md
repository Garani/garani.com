Tinkercad is an easy to use yet powerful 3D design program that runs right in your web browser. By adding and combining simple 3D shapes you can create almost anything you can imagine\! In this guide you'll learn how to create a new project, how to add shapes, and how to navigate in the Tinkercad workspace.

### Step 1: Login to Tinkercad

In a web browser, navigate to [Tinkercad.com](http://www.tinkercad.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and create a new account if you don't have one yet. If you already use Fusion 360, you can use the same Autodesk login.

### Step 2: Create a new design

Click the "Create new design" button to open up a new project.

### Step 3: Add a shape

When your project first opens, you'll see a large window on the left with a flat 3D workplane, and on the right a sidebar with several shapes to choose from. You can add a shape to the workplane by simply clicking and dragging a shape from the sidebar and dropping it on to the workplane.

### Step 4: Adjust the camera view

Imagine that you are looking through a camera at the shape you just created. To look at the shape from a different perspective, you can pan, zoom, and orbit around the workplane.

The controls for zoom and orbit are located on the left side of your screen, or you can use mouse shortcuts (see below) to control the camera.

* ORBIT: Click and drag the large cube shape (viewcube) to orbit. Or you can click on one side of the cube to quickly rotate to that side.
* HOME VIEW: Click the home button to reset the camera to the default view.
* ZOOM: Click on the zoom fit button \[F\] to focus on a specific shape. Click on the + button to zoom in, and and the - button to zoom out.
* FLAT VIEW: When the camera is looking straight down from one side (i.e. top) sometimes shapes will look distorted. Switching to Flat View will flatten the shapes so they look less distorted. This is similar to changing the camera lens.

#### Mouse shortcuts

| **Zoom** | Roll middle mouse button |
| **Orbit** | Hold right mouse button |
| **Pan** | Hold middle mouse button |
| **Move object** | Hold left mouse button |

### Step 5: Move, resize, and rotate shapes

* **MOVE:** Click on the shape in your workplane to select it. When selected, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it around on the workplane. You can also simply click + drag a shape on your workplane.
* **RESIZE:** With a shape selected, look for four tiny squares near each corner of the shape. You can click and drag these squares to adjust the length and width of your shape. There is an additional fifth square located towards the middle-top of your shape which will adjust the height.
* **ROTATE:** When a shape is selected, you'll see three curved arrow icons around your shape. Click and drag on a curved arrow to rotate your shape in that direction. There are three directions you can rotate your shape, one for each axis of rotation (x, y, and z).
* **LIFT:** In addition to moving your shape around on the workplane, you can also lift the shape up so that it floats above the workplane. With the shape selected, look for a black cone near the top of your shape. Click and drag this black cone to raise or lower the shape.

Step 6: Combine shapes and holes

Drag another shape to the workplane from the right hand menu. Move it so that it overlaps with your first shape. Now select both shapes and click the group button in the top menu. You will now have a new combined shape. Click the ungroup button to break apart a combined shape. Now select one of your shapes and in the shape dialog change it to a hole. The shape will lose its color and look slightly translucent. Now select both the shape and the hole and group them. The hole will be subtracted from the shape. Ungroup the shape and hole to reverse this action.
