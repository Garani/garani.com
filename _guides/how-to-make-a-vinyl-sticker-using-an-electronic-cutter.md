In this guide, you'll learn how to create a vinyl sticker with an electronic cutter such as the Cricut. Vinyl stickers are quite easy to make on an electronic cutter and fairly durable. You can use them for creating signs, labels, laptop stickers, bumper stickers, or use them to decorate crafts such as greeting cards.

### Step 1: Download the sticker template

Download the attached 4" x 4" sticker template and open it in [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you wish to design a different sized sticker, in Inkscape go to *File &gt; Document Properties* and scroll down to Custom Size. There you can enter your custom dimensions.

### Step 2: Think about your design

An electronic cutter works by using a small sharp knife-like tool to score a sheet of vinyl that has an adhesive backing. This means that vinyl stickers made this way are restricted to a single color. You can of course layer different color stickers on top of each other to achieve 2 or 3 color designs, but just don't expect to make a full color photo sticker with this method. Vinyl sticker designs seem to work best when they are&nbsp; simple monochromatic outlines or silhouettes.

The other thing to keep in mind is that an electronic cutter often has trouble cutting fine details.&nbsp; If your design contains lots of complexity, it may take a long time to cut and process, or the cuts will be ragged. For instance, a small thin cursive font will be much trickier to cut than a large block letter font.

### Step 3: Create your vector design

One quick way to create a design is to search for a silhouette image using [Google Image Search](http://images.google.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and then [trace the image in Inkscape](https://cplmakerlab.github.io/guide/how-to-trace-an-image-in-inkscape/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It may help to add the word "outline", "vector" or "silhouette" to your search keywords.

Example search queries:

* [owl silhouette](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=703&amp;ei=c9kuYMuYLIyUsgXty5Ao&amp;q=owl+silhouette&amp;oq=owl+silh&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAxgAMgUIABCxAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoICAAQsQMQgwFQ5gtYuhpgiiJoAHAAeAGAAZgCiAHPCZIBBTAuNy4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&amp;sclient=img){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [owl outline](https://www.google.com/search?q=owl+outline&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0g7aDrvTuAhURkawKHc_OD8gQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=owl+outline&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQsQMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgcIABCxAxBDUKsgWPMpYPYsaABwAHgAgAHXAogB8AuSAQcwLjguMC4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=o9kuYPSlOJGisgXPnb_ADA&amp;bih=703&amp;biw=1280){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [owl black and white vector](https://www.google.com/search?q=owl+black+and+white+vector&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwichI6ervTuAhVNcqwKHZr2BnEQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=owl+black+and+white+vector&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1AAWABgntsBaABwAHgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=29kuYNyqNs3ksQWa7ZuIBw&amp;bih=703&amp;biw=1280){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Once you find your image you can trace it in Inkscape to convert it to a vector. Follow our how-to guide here if you need help:

* [How to Trace an Image in Inkscape](https://cplmakerlab.github.io/guide/how-to-trace-an-image-in-inkscape/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

You can also&nbsp; create an original design from scratch within Inkscape. Explore the different shapes such as square, circle, and polygon and the pen/pencil, and text tools to get started. When selecting a font for your text, try to avoid small, thin cursive fonts. Large block letter fonts or sans-serif fonts usually work best.

### Design tips:

* Avoid overly complex features
* Simple silhouettes, outlines, and block letters work best
* In Inkscape: use solid fill colors, no strokes.

When you are done, select everything and do *Path &gt; Object to Path*. This will convert all shapes to vector paths that the machine can then follow.

To preserve the position and spacing of your elements, select shapes and do *Path &gt; Combine*. This will "fuse" the shapes into position so that they are treated as one path.

Save your file as an SVG.

### Step 4: Cut your design

We need to import it into the Cricut machine software. On a computer connected to a Cricut, go to design.cricut.com and click open. The Cricut Design Space program should open. Click "New Project."

In the left menu, choose "Upload" and then upload your SVG. After uploading, select the image and click "Insert Images" in the bottom right.
