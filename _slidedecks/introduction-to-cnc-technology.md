      ### CNC Technology


      &nbsp;


      * CNC stands for "computer numerical coding."

      * Design software translates designs into G-code which then read by the
      CNC machine.

      * The Earliest CNC machines appeared in 1940

      * CNC milling a subtractive method that removes material from a piece
      block of metal using drill bits.&nbsp;

      * CNC machines can mill using 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, or 5 axis.

      ### Manufacturing Worker Deficit


      (source:&nbsp;[American factories are desperate for workers. It's a $1
      trillion problem -
      CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/04/economy/manufacturing-jobs-economy/index.html))


      * American manufacturing activity at a 37 year high as of March 2021.

      * As many as 2.1 manufacturing jobs projected to be unfilled through 2030.

      * Part of the shortage is due to concerns about globalization and
      automation.
