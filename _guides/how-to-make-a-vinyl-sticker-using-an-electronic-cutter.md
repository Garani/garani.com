In this guide, you'll learn how to create a vinyl sticker with an electronic cutter such as the Cricut. Vinyl stickers are quite easy to make on an electronic cutter and fairly durable. You can use them for creating signs, labels, laptop stickers, bumper stickers, or use them to decorate crafts such as greeting cards.

### Step 1: Download the sticker template

Download the attached 4" x 4" sticker template and open it in [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you wish to design a different sized sticker, in Inkscape go to *File &gt; Document Properties* and scroll down to Custom Size. There you can enter your custom dimensions.

### Step 2: Think about your design

An electronic cutter works by using a small sharp knife-like tool to score a sheet of vinyl that has an adhesive backing. This means that vinyl stickers made this way are restricted to ONE color. You can of course stack different color stickers on top of each other to achieve 2 or 3 color designs, but just keep in mind that you won't be able to make a full color photo sticker. Vinyl sticker designs seem to work best when they are&nbsp; monochromatic outlines or silhouettes.

The other thing to keep in mind is that an electronic-cutter often has trouble cutting very fine details.&nbsp; If your design contains lots of complexity, it may take a long time to cut and process, or the cuts will be ragged and messy. For instance, a small thin cursive font will be much tougher to cut than a large block letter font.
