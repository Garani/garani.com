**Time/ Shipping**





**Time Considerations**

\- Do I need my object fabricated to meet a certain deadline?

\- You will usually need to give companies at least 3 weeks.

\- Do I need to make multiple prototypes? How can I check scale,

or if parts fit together?

\- Check material properties lists from the company to see

how much particular materials shrink.





**Ethics**





**Labor/ Waste**

\- Is the company green/ environmentally sustainable?

\- Can the material I use be recycled later on?

\- How are the employees treated? Have there been any

reports about mistreatment?

**Manufacturing on a Large Scale**

\- If you need to make 100+ of an item, you

might want to contact a company to make

your product.

\- Previously mentioned outsourcing

companies can still be used for cheap

prototypes, but you shouldn’t use them to

make 100 of an item in most circumstances.

\- Craftcloud from All3DP lets you compare

with quantity as a setting
