      ## Java&nbsp;


      * Runs fast.&nbsp;

      * Embedded and cross platform application. Particularly interactive
      features in websites.&nbsp;

      * Over 3 billion devices use Java.&nbsp;

      ## C (C++, C\#)


      * One of the oldest programing languages (1972).&nbsp;

      * Influenced C++ (1985) and C\# (2000) which are extensions of the
      original program.&nbsp;

      * Used for system programing and databases. Embedded systems such as car
      interfaces are often programmed in C.&nbsp;

      ## Python


      * Concise syntax. Shorter code needed to perform functions than other
      programs.

      * Easier to learn than C and Java.&nbsp;

      * Best for data science, AI, machine learning.&nbsp;

      &nbsp;


      **Certification Program:** A certificate demonstrates you have a single
      skill, often not granted by a university. Often take a few weeks to
      several months to complete.


      &nbsp;


      **University Program:**&nbsp;Degrees take longer, there are different
      requirements for an Associates Degree (generally 2 years) and a Bachelors
      degree (generally 4 years).
