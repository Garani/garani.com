This guide demonstrates how to edit a site page (such as the home page) for the CPL Maker Lab website using the CloudCannon admin interface.

### Step 1

Log in to [CloudCannon](cloudcannon.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. CloudCannon is a website management platform.&nbsp; CloudCannon will sync changes to Github Pages, where the site is hosted.

### Step 2

When you first login, it will show you a list of your websites. For the free tier of CloudCannon, you can only create one website. Click the big square icon to open the website dashboard.

&nbsp;

## Step 3

Click on Explore &gt; Site Pages to see a list of your site pages. The home page will usually have the url listed as index. Click on the homepage to open it in the content editor.

&nbsp;

### Step 4

In the sidebar, enter a title for your blog post. You can manually enter in the date or simply leave the field blank. If left blank it will populate the time field when it is first published.

Feel free to add as many tags as you'd like. The tags will be displayed at the bottom of your post where visitors can look up related posts by tag.

### Step 5

It's a good idea to save early & often, so go ahead and click the SAVE button. CloudCannon will display status messages as it saves and rebuilds the site.

### Step 6

On the right side is where you'll enter the content for your blog post. Use the content editor toolbar to format your text. Hover your mouse over a toolbar icon to reveal what it does.

You can embed images using the Image button in the content editor toolbar. Please try to keep images a reasonable size (~1024px wide) as they cannot be resized after you upload to CloudCannon. Files will be saved to the /uploads folder.

You can create links by highlighting some text and then clicking the Link button. It's probably a good idea to have external links open in a new window/tab. You can also use links to upload and link files within your blog post.

## Step 7

When you are done writing your blog post, don't forget to hit SAVE\!

## Step 8

Your new blog post will be published at [cplmakerlab.github.io/blog](http://cplmakerlab.github.io/blog){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Note that it may take a few minutes for any changes to appear as your site must resync & rebuild after every save.

Note: If you chose to create a DRAFT first, the blog will not be published until you publish the draft. To do that, click the PUBLISH button at the top of the page.
