A slide deck is an HTML slideshow that can be used for presentations. This guide demonstrates how to create a slideshow on the CPL Maker Lab website using the CloudCannon admin interface.

### Step 1

Log in to [CloudCannon](cloudcannon.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. CloudCannon is a website management platform.&nbsp; CloudCannon will sync changes to Github Pages, where the site is hosted.

### Step 2

When you first login, it will show you a list of websites. With the free tier of CloudCannon, you can only create one website. Click to open the website dashboard.

### Step 5

Enter a title for your slide to help you remember it later, and use the rich text editor to create your slide. Keep each slide short and sweet\! It's easy to add new slides if needed. Bullet points are useful when presenting. It's best to only feature one image or video per slide as they take up a lot of space. You can also add a background color or background image for your slide if you'd like.

### Step 6

It's a good idea to save your work as you go. Click the Save button at the top. CloudCannon may display a status message as the site is rebuilt. Click the "Return to Slide deck" to view your list of slides.

## Step 8

Add a new slide and give it a title , but this time don't add any text, just upload a background image. The background image will fill the entire screen and will be easy for people to see. Don't forget to hit save\!

## Step 9

To view your slide deck, go to [cplmakerlab.github.io/slidedecks](http://cplmakerlab.github.io/slidedecks){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and click on your new slide deck, which will open in a new window. Be aware that it may take a minute or two to see your changes as the site needs time to rebuild after every change. When presenting, take advantage of the built-in keyboard shortcuts\!
