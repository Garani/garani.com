      #### Why use a 3D Scanner?


      1. To make an exact copy of an existing item with a 3D printer

      2. To iterate (slightly modify) an existing design

      3. To add the scanned item into a digital artwork, animated film, video
      game, or virtual reality environment&nbsp;

      4. To create virtual copies of items for preservation purposes

      #### How do 3D scanners work?


      #### They use one of these:&nbsp;


      * Photogrammetry: measurements calculated from 20-250+ photographs

      * Structured Light: triangulates dimensions using small camera &
      &nbsp;projector

      * LASER Triangulation: LIDAR, determines time it takes for laser to
      return&nbsp;

      * Contact Based: probes the item using physical touch
